    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Welcome to PriceBot. By accessing or using our service, you agree to these Terms.
        If you don’t agree, please close this tab, go make a sandwich, and forget we exist.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use of Service</h2>
    <p>
        - You may use PriceBot to compare prices.
        - You may NOT use PriceBot to summon demons, hack the Matrix, or test your toaster’s WiFi.
        - We reserve the right to laugh at unreasonable product searches like "unicorn iPhone charger".
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        - Don’t break our website.
        - Don’t pretend you own PriceBot unless you’re ready to also handle the bugs.
        - If you find cheaper prices than us, congrats — we’ll pretend we didn’t see it.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        PriceBot is provided "as is".
        We are not responsible if:
        - Your phone explodes while browsing.
        - You buy 42 blenders because of a typo.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Modifications</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these Terms anytime. Usually around 2 AM, when we’re bored and think
        “hey, let’s add some more nonsense”.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to terminate your access to BrokeBro if:
        - You misuse the site.
        - You keep searching “free pizza”.
        - You insult Spider-Man. That one’s unforgivable.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of Common Sense™ and the International Code of Meme Justice.
    </p>
