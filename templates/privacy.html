    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Welcome to PriceBot! We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.
        Please note: half of this is legal gibberish to look professional 🤷.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        - When you search products, we may collect basic data like query terms.
        - We do not collect your DNA, shoe size, or your grandmother’s secret recipes.
        - Some anonymous logs may be generated for site analytics (mostly us staring at charts pretending to be busy).
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        - To show you product comparisons (duh).
        - To improve our services (aka adding more bugs).
        - To ensure Spider-Man doesn’t crash our servers while swinging around in the code.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell or rent your personal data.
        Unless Jeff Bezos offers us a trillion dollars, in which case… well, we’ll think about it.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement "industry-standard" practices such as passwords on sticky notes,
        and shouting at the server until it obeys.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You may contact us anytime to:
        - Request deletion of your non-existent data.
        - Ask why this Privacy Policy contains jokes.
        - Tell us we need to get a life.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy randomly, usually at 3 AM after too much coffee.
    </p>
